      After successfully enabling GitHub Pages for your repository, the final step
      involves accessing your website. Once activated, GitHub Pages provides you with
      a dedicated URL where your project is hosted. Simply click on the provided link
      and you'll be directed to your live website. This URL serves as the gateway for you
      and others to explore, share, and interact with the content <span style =" color: red;"> you
      published</span>. Whether it is a showcase of your latest project, your first website, or
      a personal resume, accessing your GitHub Pages website is as simple as clicking the generated
      URL.
